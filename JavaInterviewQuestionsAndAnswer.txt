1). Question: Diamond problem (sometimes referred to as the "Deadly Diamond of Death")
		
			Java does not support multiple inheritance (with classes).
			During inheritance a copy of super class members is created in the sub class object. 
				Therefore, using the sub class object you can access the members of the both classes.
	 Answer:
	 	Let us assume , 
	 			Class A (Abstract), having abstract method demo()
	 			Class B extends Class A
	 			Class C extends Class A
	 			Class D extends Class B and Class C
	 				As per the basic rule of inheritance, a copy of both demo() methods should be created in the subclass object 
	 			which leaves the subclass with two methods with same prototype (name and arguments). Then, if you call the demo()
	 			method using the object of the subclass compiler faces an ambiguous situation not knowing which method to call. 
	 			This issue is known as diamond problem in Java.
